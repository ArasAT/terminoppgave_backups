            <h1 class="h1text">FAQ</h1> 

                <h3 class="h3textfaq">Why does it say this website is not secured?</h3>
                
                    <p class="normaltextfaq">
                        This is because this side is "http" and not "https". This means that hackers can access the data on this 
                        site if they try. Because of this, you should try not to use a password that you use on other sites/devices.
                    </p>

                <h3 class="h3textfaq">Where is my data stored?</h3>

                    <p class="normaltextfaq">
                        Everytime you get a point the ball turns gold and makes a sound.

                <p class="normaltextfaq">
